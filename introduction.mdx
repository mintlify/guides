## Who is this guide for?

This guide is designed for anyone responsible for writing documentation, but it isn't their primary role. Developers, founders, customer success managers, product managers, and anyone else who wants their users to have high quality documentation.

If you're a technical writer, we would love to hear your thoughts on anything we're missing in this guide! Drop us a line at hi@mintlify.com.

## How was this guide written?

We interviewed and compiled insights from tenured technical writers with experience at companies like Stripe, Amplitude, Anaconda, and GitHub.

We centered interviews on the most frequently asked questions from our customers about how to create best-in-class documentation.

## How is this guide updated?

These principles are meant to be evergreen but we're always open to feedback. If there is something you think we should change or add, let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/mintlify/guides/issues/new).
