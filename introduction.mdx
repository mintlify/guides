## Who is this guide for?

This guide is designed for developers, founders, customer success, product managers—anyone responsible for writing documentation, though it’s not their primary role. 

If you’re a technical writer, we’d love to hear your thoughts on anything we’re missing in this guide! Drop us a line at hi@mintlify.com.

## How was it written?

We interviewed and compiled insights from tenured technical writers with experience at companies like Stripe, Amplitude, Anaconda, and GitHub. 

We centered interviews on the most frequently asked questions from our customers about how to create best-in-class documentation.

## How is it updated?

These principles are meant to be evergreen but we’re always open to feedback. If there’s something you think we should change or add, let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/mintlify/guides/issues/new) or [contacting us](https://mintlify.com/contact).
